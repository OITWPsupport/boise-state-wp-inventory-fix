# boise-state-wp-inventory-fix
Plugin for programmatically fixing minor accessibility issues introduced by the WP Inventory plugin.

The WP Inventory plugin (and the associated WP Inventory Import Export Add-on) are installed and active on veterans.boisestate.edu and nowhere else in our domain as of July 2017. There is an active project to move that site to use Woocommerce summer 2017, and when that's complete, WP Inventory plugins (including this one) can be deleted.
